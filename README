CELLOUT(1)                                                          CELLOUT(1)

       -g     Print graphical progress bar.

BUGS
       Some  versions  of  awk  interpret  -g  as an option to the interpreter
       rather than the script. To avoid this, notify your awk interpreter that
       there  are  no  more interpreter options with --, or your interpreter's
       equivalent.

       Please report any bugs at https://github.com/cdown/cellout/issues.
